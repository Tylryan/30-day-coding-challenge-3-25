# Notes
- 04-06-2024: I can't seem to figure out how to implement functions that can do a fibonacci sequence recursively. Since I'm pretty much using the ideas I've learned from reading crafting interpreters, I'll try to implement Jlox line for line. Hopefully I'll be able to wrap my mind around a working example in Java and be able to use it in LangLang.
