# 30 Coding Challenge
Below are the goals that I would like to achieve in this 30 day period.
- [x] jLox implemented
- [ ] pLox: Translate jLox into pLox using a simpler design pattern.
- [ ] langlang: Be able to implement langlang on the spot.
    - Pretty much Lox but more expressive
    - Everything is an expression
    - Implicit returns
- [ ] cLox: Start

## Bonus Goals
- [ ] Types
- [ ] Anonymous functions
- [ ] Enums
- [ ] Lists/Vectors
- [ ] IO
- [ ] Imports
- [ ] Implement langlang using langlang

# Notes
- 04-06-2024: I can't seem to figure out how to implement functions that can do a fibonacci sequence recursively. Since I'm pretty much using the ideas I've learned from reading crafting interpreters, I'll try to implement Jlox line for line. Hopefully I'll be able to wrap my mind around a working example in Java and be able to use it in LangLang.
